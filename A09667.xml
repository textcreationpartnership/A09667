            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p n="2">2 In the banquets of the world is varietie of meates, and the gre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter that the diuerſitie of meate is ſo much more ſumptuous in the banquet, for that one forte of meate not conteining the taſte and perfection of the others can not content or ſatiſſie the gueſts: But in this ſacred banquet, <hi>In quo Chriſtus Sumitur:</hi> In which Chriſt is receaued; is preſent one only kinde of meate, which is Chriſt Ieſus, who becauſe he is
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:6437:28"/>infinite, conteineth in him ſelfe all perfection; and this alone is able to ſatiſſie and content man: A figure whereof was Manna, the which had all kinde of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and all ſweetnes of taſte.</p>
               <p n="3">3 In the banquets of the worlde men are accuſto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>med to talke not of death neither of ſuffering tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel and torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, but of ioyfull &amp; cheerfull matters.

               <p n="4">4 <hi>Mens impletur gratia</hi> the mind is filled with grace.

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:6437:29"/>filled with meates, that often times they bring diſeaſes vnto the body, and ſpirituall dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage vnto the ſoule.</p>
               <p n="5">5 The banquets of the worlde by meanes of the greate diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and exceſſe which is vſed in them, ſend ſoules into hell and ſo they are as pledges of eternall paines: But the ſacred banquet of Chriſt, laieth heauen open vnto vs, being the pledge of eternall felicitie: for which cauſe in the <hi>Antheme</hi> it is ſaide. <hi>Et futura glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria nobis pignus da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur:</hi> The pledge of future glorie is giuen vnto vs.</p>

               <p>As though ſeldome recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing did make vs worthy, it is not ſo, but if by being worthie you vnderſtand that one ſhould be equall in perfection with this Sacrament, then it is certaine that no creature albeit moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, no nor yet all creatures to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither

            <head>Of ſpirituall receauing the Bleſſed Sacrament of the Altar. <hi>CHAP. XXII.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>FOR that ſpirituall receauing is very fruitfull and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for ſoules, I will here breefly intreat therof; that deuout per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons knowing what it is, &amp; how it ought to be donne, may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe comfort and profite them ſelues therby. I will ſpeake ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore offower thinges. Firſt wher in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſteth ſpirituall receauing. Secondly, what fruit it bringeth vnto the ſoule. Thirdlye, what preparatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it requireth, and the maner how to practiſe it. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:6437:105"/>how gratefull it is vnto Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Concerning the firſt, it is to be noted that as well ſpirituall receauing, as Sacramentall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating, are gronnded vpon faith: becauſe that a partie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing that in the Bleſſed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment remaineth our Lorde, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of all our good, he is moued to receaue him ſeeing that for this end he hath lefte him ſelfe vnder the forme of bread that we therby ſhold feed our ſoules, wherfore when as really we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecrated Hoaſt, it is called Sacramentall receauing, but when we receaue it onely with affection &amp; deſire, it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Spirituall receauing. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue therfore Spiritually is no other, then to deſire with affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of hart the Bleſſed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:6437:105"/>that by meanes therof we might be vnited and incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Chriſt our Lord. And after this maner are to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood theſe words of <hi>S. Ambroſe Non manducans ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ducat.</hi> Some which eate not the body of our Lord Sacramentally, do eat the ſame Spiritually.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Concerning the ſecond, it is to be noted that the fruit which Spirituall receauing bringeth vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to our ſoule, is the grace of the felfe ſame Sacrament with ſome other effectes, for as he which being moued by the holy Ghoſt beleeueth, repenteth him of his ſinnes, and louin gof God, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to be baptiſed, receaueth the grace of Baptiſme, and this deſire to be baptiſed is called of diuines, <hi>Baptiſmus flaminis;</hi> euen ſo the like is alſo in this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:6437:106"/>It is very trew as the holy Councell of Trent noteth, <hi>Seſ.</hi> 13. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. that he which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municateth ſpiritually receiueth not all the effectes of the bleſſed Sacrament, as he doth which be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing worthely diſpoſed and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared receaueth alſo Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally, wherof I haue ſpoken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the Annotation of the fourth Meditation. <hi>S. Thom. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſculo.</hi> 58. <hi>cap.</hi> 19. towards the end maketh mention of three effectes of ſpirituall receauing. The firſt is remiſſion of ſinnes; The ſecond is, deliuerie from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall death. The third is trew participation of the ſacred body of our Lord to eternall ſaluation</p>
            <p n="3">3 Concerning the third, it is to be noted that the preparation and manner of ſpirituall recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſteth in theſe 5. points.
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:6437:106"/>Firſt when as the partie is readie to heare Maſſe, let him purpoſe in minde to communicate ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually praying vnto our Lord to vouchſafe to make him partaker of the fruit of this venerable Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. Secondly brefly let him examine his conſcience repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him of his defectes, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding pardon of Almightie God, with purpoſe of amending &amp; of confeſſing of them at dew time, and of him ſelfe he may do ſome little pennance. Thirdly, when the Preiſt is at the <hi>Offerto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> he ſhall alſo offer vp him ſelf vnto our Lord, praying him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to make him partaker of the vertue of the moſt holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and for this end he ſhal pray vnto the moſt B. Virgin or ſome other of his deuoted Saints to be his interceſſors. Fourthly,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:6437:107"/>when as the Prieſt is ready to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>municate, let him recollect him ſelfe as if he would communicat Sacramentally, and afterwarde with deuout affection let him re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceaue the holy <hi>Euchariſt</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally into his ſoule. Fiftly &amp; fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, let him giue thankes vnto Almightie. God. That which is here ſpoken of the holy Maſſe, is not ſaid, for that it is neceſſarie for the partie which would com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>municate ſpirituallye, to heare Maſſe or to do theſe thinges in the time of Maſſe, becauſe that he may do the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in his cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber out of Maſſe, &amp; diuerſe times in the day. But I haue ſpoken this for that ſpirituall receauing is more eaſelie donne and with greater deuotion in the time of the holy ſacrifice of the Maſſe.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Concerning the fourth thing
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:6437:107"/>which is, how gratfull vnro Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God is ſpirituall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating or deſire of Recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the holy <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> this I ſay may eaſely be vnderſtood by theſe miracles.</p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>S. Ambroſe</hi> drawing neere vnto death, was much afflicted for that he carneſtly deſired to communicate, and could not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the ſame by wordes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had loſt his ſpeach: But Almightie God three times in the night called vnto <hi>Honoratus</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Vexcells,</hi> and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him to go and giue the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Sacrament vnto <hi>Ambroſe</hi> his ſeruant; who ſeeing the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred body of our Lord, exulted in ſpirite and receaued the ſame deuoutly.</p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>Marullus</hi> writeth in his 4. booke and 12 chapter, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Pſ.</hi> 109.) offered vp to Almightie God, and afterwards left vnto vs his body vnder the forme of bread, and his bloud vnder the forme of wine, the holy fathers do generally ſay. This figure gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs to vnderſtand, that to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue Chriſt in the moſt holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>crament, and to be bleſſed of him, it is neceſſarie that we haue fought againſt our inordinate paſſions, and with Contrition &amp; Confeſſion drinen away ſinne, as valorous <hi>Abraham</hi> draue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:6437:110"/>thoſe Kinges his enimies.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The ſecond figure of this moſt holy Sacrament was the bread of propoſition, which was kept on the table of the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> in the ſight of god. <hi>Exod.</hi> 25. <hi>Leuit</hi> 24. It was not lawful for any one to eate of this bread vnleſſe he were cleane and ſanctified, for which cauſe 1. <hi>Reg.</hi> 21. <hi>Mat.</hi> 12 it was called holy bread; and ſanctified bread. By the which is ſignified vnto vs, that for to eate the moſt holy meate of the lawe of grace figured thereby, it is neceſſary that the partie be chaſt, &amp; haue a pure conſcience.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The third figure of this diuine Sacrament, was the Subcineriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all bread, which the Angell brought vnto <hi>Elias,</hi> who being comforted with the vertue of that bread, as the ſcripture ſaith
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:6437:111"/>3. <hi>Reg.</hi> 19. walked fortie daies and fortie nights, euen vnto the mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taine of God, <hi>Horeb.</hi> where afterwards he ſawe our Lorde. This figure ſignifieth vnto vs the force and vertue which the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Sacrament giueth vnto vs, to walke in this laborſom pilgri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mage, euen vnto the mountaine where we ſhall ſee God to our incredible contentment. Now then, as ordinary and common bread, 1. conſerueth our tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral life. 2. augmenteth &amp; ſtrengh theneth vs. 3. albeit we often eate whileſt we are in health, yet it is neuer loathſome: yea rather it is an ill ſigne when any one li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not bread 4. without bread the banquet is neuer perfect al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it abound with all other pretious meate: Euen ſo this hea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uenly meate vnder the forme of
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:6437:111"/>bread, conſerueth our ſpirituall life 2. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ferring or giuing grace which is the life of the ſoule, it augmenteth the ſame and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it more ſtrong againſt all aſſaultes of the deuell 3. this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred meate is neuer loathſome vnto ſpirituall men, and if ſo be that it pleaſeth not the ſicke, it is becauſe that <hi>Animalis homo non percipit quae Dei ſunt.</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. the ſenſuall man perceiueth not thoſe things that are of God. 4. Let a Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue al the goods of this mortall life. yet if he haue not there with all, that which is conteined in the ſacred <hi>Hoaſt,</hi> it is worth nothing, or rather he may trewly be accounted moſt miſerable. Finally bread before that it commeth vnto his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, ſuffereth very much, for corne which is the matter of
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:6437:112"/>bread, firſt is ſowne in the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d harrowed &amp; couered with earth afterwards it is reaped, threſhed in the flower, winnowed with the ſieue, grounde in the mill, moulded or made into loaues finally it is baked in the hoate fierie ouen, wherefore it verie well agreeth with this B. Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which repreſenteth vnto vs the paſſion of Chriſt our Lord which ſuffered ſo much for vs.</p>
            <p n="4">4 The fourth figure was the paſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>call Lambe <hi>Exod.</hi> 12, whoſe ceremonies were theſe. The Lambe ought to bee with-out ſpot, of male kinde, and one yeare oulde, It was to be eaten roſted, and in haſte, with wilde lettice and alſo with vnleuened bread, and they which did eate it, ſhould haue their loines gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, with ſtaues in their hand, and with ſhoes on their feete, by
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:6437:112"/>which ceromonies God ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto the Iews that they were pilgrimes and waiefairing men</p>

               <hi>S.

So much the more, (ſaith the ſame Saint) in that moſt greate paines are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for thoſe which vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thely do eate the ſame.</p>
            <p n="5">5 The fift figure was the <hi>Manna Exod.</hi> 16. which God gaue to the people of Iſrael in the deſert after they had paſſed the red ſea whileſt that they went vnto the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:6437:113"/>land of promiſe.</p>

            <p>The <hi>Manna</hi> had theſe proper<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ties. Firſt, ſome gathered much and other ſome gathered little; but yet afterwards all found the ſelfe ſame meaſure. Euen ſo the ſelfe ſame Sacrament, and the ſelfe ſame vertue is in the whole conſecrated Hoaſt, and in euery little particle therof.</p>
            <p>Wherfore in the <hi>Himne</hi> made

            <p n="4">4.

Euen ſo it hach happened vnto many, who hauing diſpiſed the moſt holie <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> are become either he retickes or bad Chriſtians: And therfore <hi>S.

            <p n="6">6 The ſixt figure was the Arke wherof <hi>S. Thomas</hi> intreatinge: ſayeth.<note place="margin">I. B. q. <hi>102.</hi> ar. <hi>4.</hi> ad <hi>6</hi> Exod. <hi>25</hi>

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth of moſte pure members. Furthermore the Arcke was gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted both within &amp; without, the which gilting ſignified the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and charitie of Chriſt our Lord. In the Arcke were three thinges. Firſt there was a gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den potte, wherin was kept con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined <hi>Manna,</hi> and was a figure of the ſoule of Chriſt which con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teineth all fulnes of ſanctitie and diuinitie. Secondlye, there was the Rod of <hi>Aron,</hi> the which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified the Preiſtlike power and authoritie of CHRIST. Thirdly ther were the two tables, which ſignified that Chriſt ſhould be a lawgiuer. And as the Arck ſtood in the tabernacle couered with a vealc.<note place="margin">

            <p>Two ſpeciall things beſides many others, the holy ſcripture reherfeth of the Arke, the which are alſo maruailouſly ſeene in this Sacrament.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, that God by means of the Arcke beſtowed innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable benefittes vpon the ſonnes of Iſraell, not only in perticuler to that houſe, which receaued the Arke worthelie, as he did vn to the houſe of <hi>Obededo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>;</hi> which by the coming of the Arcke was bleſſed of God,<note place="margin">

<pb n="219" facs="tcp:6437:115"/>In like maner this diuine Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not onely bringeth bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinges to all thoſe which wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelie receaue the ſame into the houſe of their ſoule, but alſo to Prouinces &amp; whole Kingdomes ouer whoſe wicked ſinnes and offences God taketh not gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall reuenge in reſpecte of this moſt venerable Sacrament.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing is that God greuouſly puniſhed thoſe which did not reuerence the Arke as in dewtie they ought: or elſe vſed the ſame vndece<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. 1. Reg. 4.</p>
            <p>The people of Iſraell hauing in one battell, which they had with the <hi>Philiſtians,</hi> loſt fower thouſand fighting men, they made meanes that the Arcke ſhould bee brought into their tentes, thinking that by the

But it hapned cleane co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie, for that the arke was taken by the enimies, and of their owte armie were killed and ſlaine thirtie thouſand; for puniſhment of their little deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and bad life.
